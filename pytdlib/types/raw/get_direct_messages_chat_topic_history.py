    :param from_message_id: Identifier of the message starting from which messages must be fetched; use 0 to get results from the last message
    :param offset: Specify 0 to get results from exactly the message from_message_id or a negative offset up to 99 to get additionally some newer messages
    :param limit: The maximum number of messages to be returned; must be positive and can't be greater than 100. If the offset is negative, the limit must be greater than or equal to -offset.
