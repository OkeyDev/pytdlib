class OptimizeStorage(Function):
    """
    Optimizes storage usage, i.e. deletes some files and returns new storage usage statistics. Secret thumbnails can't be deleted

    :param size: Limit on the total size of files after deletion, in bytes. Pass -1 to use the default limit
    :param ttl: Limit on the time that has passed since the last time a file was accessed (or creation time for some filesystems). Pass -1 to use the default limit
    :param count: Limit on the total number of files after deletion. Pass -1 to use the default limit
    :param immunity_delay: The amount of time after the creation of a file during which it can't be deleted, in seconds. Pass -1 to use the default value
    :param file_types: If non-empty, only files with the given types are considered. By default, all types except thumbnails, profile photos, stickers and wallpapers are deleted
    :param chat_ids: If non-empty, only files from the given chats are considered. Use 0 as chat identifier to delete files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos)
    :param exclude_chat_ids: If non-empty, files from the given chats are excluded. Use 0 as chat identifier to exclude all files not belonging to any chat (e.g., profile photos)
    :param return_deleted_file_statistics: Pass true if statistics about the files that were deleted must be returned instead of the whole storage usage statistics. Affects only returned statistics
    :param chat_limit: Same as in getStorageStatistics. Affects only returned statistics
    :return: :class:`StorageStatistics`
