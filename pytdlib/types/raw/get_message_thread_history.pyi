class GetMessageThreadHistory(Function[Messages]):
    """
    Returns messages in a message thread of a message. Can be used only if messageProperties.can_get_message_thread == true. Message thread of a channel message is in the channel's linked supergroup. The messages are returned in reverse chronological order (i.e., in order of decreasing message_id). For optimal performance, the number of returned messages is chosen by TDLib

    :param chat_id: Chat identifier
    :param message_id: Message identifier, which thread history needs to be returned
    :param from_message_id: Identifier of the message starting from which history must be fetched; use 0 to get results from the last message
    :param offset: Specify 0 to get results from exactly the message from_message_id or a negative offset up to 99 to get additionally some newer messages
    :param limit: The maximum number of messages to be returned; must be positive and can't be greater than 100. If the offset is negative, the limit must be greater than or equal to -offset. For optimal performance, the number of returned messages is chosen by TDLib and can be smaller than the specified limit
